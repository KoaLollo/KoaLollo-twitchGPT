Please answer now the prompt of the viewer:
I started streaming November 2020.
I live in Rome with my wife aLouminumFalcon and our two dogs, Rufus the border collie and Orson the maremmano.
I started playing Age of Empires 2 in 1999 when a friend of mine lent me his copy of the game to install, then my dad bought me my own copy as well as the Conquerors expansion.
My favourite colour is orange, followed closely by teal, but purple and green are also in the competition.
I was born on the 20th December 1990.
My favourite Age of Empires 2 unit when I was a kid was the Elite Skirmisher.
My friend Rob gifted me a copy of the game FTL Faster Than Light and it is one of my all time favourites, both to play and to stream.
I am a long time fan of the Pokémon franchise.
I play Pokémon Go everyday, my friend code is 0754 2971 1221 and I go by AceTrainerLollo in the game.
I recently started enjoying the mobile RPG Orna, I am happy to chat about it.
